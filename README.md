Verbum sat sapienti est - Smart ones do not need anything more than a word (lat.)

This Latin proverb literally means that there is no need to make an extensive explanation for those who *know*. They will understand you from a simple reference to the concept of interest.

However, we believe, that in our times the proverb could be interpreted in a way that doing a speech-interfaced application one has to be alert not to fall victim to the bundled selling of large corporations. Ideally the speech application designer has to have access to the discreet and efficient speech processing API that does its job, does it well and does not attempt to force its customer into a bunch of unrelated deals.

In this *modern* sense the proverb is exactly the conceptual foundation behind our effort. We are building an efficient high-performant *tool* that has the simplest possible interface and is available on any web-connected device or application. Our cloud-based application servers are supported by the specialized hardware, which allows us to deliver the state-of-the-art accuracy within the real-time processing constraints of an interactive speech interface while searching for the answer through a practically unlimited vocabulary. We also promise you to deliver any kind of details about the recognition result that you might become interested in while designing your application. That is not limited to the segmentation through time, possible alternative transcriptions and telling you how confident the system was while doing its job, we would love to give you as many speech and speaker characteristics as we possibly can. Think of speaker identity, gender, age, accent, emotional state, suggestion of a semantic interpretation of the rendered lexical string, etc. You tell us what you need and we will do our best to deliver it.

We consider our project to be less of a business and more of a long term partnership with our customers to jointly solve the complexity of ubiquitous speech-enabled interaction between humans and machines. Machines will become smart only when they learn to efficiently communicate with us our way,- i.e. through words.
