Verbum Sat Sapienti Est - Smart ones do not need anything more than a word (lat.) 

This Latin proverb literally means that there is no need to make an extensive explanation for those who know. They will understand you from a simple reference to the concept you are interested in. 

However, we believe that in our time the proverb could be interpreted in a way that doing a speech-interfaced application one has to be alert not to fall victim to the bundled selling of large corporations. Ideally application designer has to have access to the discreet and efficient speech processing API that does its job, does it well and does not attempt to force its user into a bunch of unrelated deals.

In this *modern* sense the proverb is exactly the conceptual foundation behind our effort. We are building an efficient high-performant tool that has the simplest possible interface. The application server is supported by the specialized hardware, which allows us to deliver the state-of-the-art accuracy within the real-time processing constraints of an interactive speech interface. We promise you to deliver any kind details about the recognition result that you might become interested in while designing your application. That is not limited to the segmentation through time, possible alternative transcriptions and telling you how much confidence the system had while committing to its hypothesis, we may give you many sorts of speech and speaker characteristics, such as: speaker identity, gender, accent, emotional state, suggest semantic interpretation of the rendered lexical string.

We consider our project to be less of a business and more of a long term partership with our customers to jointly solve complexity of ubiquitous speech-enabled human-machine interaction.
